 # ETV (Explore The Vacuum)
 Computation in General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory

ETV (Explore The Vacuum) is a project designed to simulate and visualize various phenomena in a vacuum environment. This project includes Python modules for performing calculations in relativity and quantum field theory. Currently, it supports symbolic computations, with plans to add numerical capabilities in the future.

## Project Modules

The project contains the following Python modules:

- **Christoffel.py**: Computes Christoffel symbols of a given metric.
- **Ricci.py**: Calculates the Ricci tensor and scalar curvature of a given space-time.
- **Lagrangian.py**: Calculates the gravitational Lagrangian given the Ricci scalar and the metric tensor.
- **standard_metrics.py**: Currently supports only the Schwarzschild metric.
- **generate_coordinates.py**: Generates a custom coordinate vector based on user input for a generic space-time dimension.
- **metric_tensor.py**: Generates a user-defined metric tensor, given a coordinate vector.
- **utils.py**: Performs various operations on tensors and vectors.

Note: Currently, there are no functions to perform calculations in quantum field theory.
